Toy repository for playing a physics problem I've thought about a few times:

What is the optimal angle to shoot/throw a projectile at to maximize distance traveled along a surface that is elevated relative to its origin?

* the red line is always showing the 45ยบ arc, which is optimal if the surface you are shooting/throwing on to is level with you.
* the green line is the arc from the origin that just barely clears the "cliff"
* the blue line is the path that maximizes the distance to the landing point on the top of the cliff.
* The black and grey paths can be dragged around as just an example of an arbitrary path in the space, or to change the velocity; they can mostly be ignored here.

Run with:

```
nodemon server.js
```

This is largely an experiment for me to get comfortable building React components for SVGs.
